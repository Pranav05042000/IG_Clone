# IG_Clone
IG_Clone (SQL) is a project aimed at creating a simplified version of the popular social media platform Instagram using SQL for the database management. 

The project utilizes SQL as the primary database management system to store and retrieve user information, posts, comments, likes, and other relevant data. It provides a comprehensive SQL schema and associated queries to handle various functionalities efficiently.

## Key Features:

User Management: Users can create accounts, log in, and update their profiles. The system securely stores user credentials, such as usernames and passwords, and manages user sessions.

Image Upload and Display: Users can upload images from their devices and view them in their profiles and the main feed. The system ensures secure storage and retrieval of images.

Following and Followers: Users can follow other users and see posts from the users they follow in their feed. The system manages the relationships between users and provides efficient queries to retrieve relevant information.

Likes and Comments: Users can like and comment on posts. The system keeps track of likes and comments associated with each post and provides functionality to retrieve and display them.

Notifications: Users receive notifications for activities related to their posts, such as new likes and comments. The system maintains a notification mechanism to keep users informed about relevant interactions.

Search Functionality: Users can search for other users by username or other relevant criteria. The system provides efficient search queries to retrieve matching results.

Data Privacy and Security: The project implements security measures to protect user data and ensure that only authorized users can access and modify their own information. It incorporates proper validation and sanitization techniques to prevent common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection attacks.
